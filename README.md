Abalone Age Prediction using Machine Learning
Abalone
Predicting abalone age (rings) using physical features with machine learning.

Overview
This project aims to predict the age of abalones (measured by the number of rings on their shells) using machine learning models. Abalone age is crucial for sustainable fishing, as older abalones are larger and more valuable. Instead of manually counting rings, we automate the process using regression models trained on features like length, height, weight, and sex.

Dataset
The dataset contains 4,177 samples with the following attributes:

Physical Measurements: Length, Diameter, Height, Weight (Whole, Shucked, Viscera, Shell)

Categorical: Sex (Male, Female, Infant)

Target Variable: Rings (indicator of age)

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Abalone Dataset
